Simple implementations of Bandit Algorithms, specifically for Bernoulli Bandits. Implementations are based on pseudocode given from the textbooks 'A Tutorial on Thompson Sampling'(https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02038) and 'Bandit Algorithms' (1.Lattimore T, Szepesv√°ri C. Stochastic Bandits with 
Finitely Many Arms. In: Bandit Algorithms. Cambridge University Press; 2020:73-74.)
